# Platforms supported:
We know that we said that due to the change of the roadmap, we would launch the P2E protocol for PC only. Well… We like to over-deliver and we have a good surprise for you.

The protocol will support:
- **PC**
- **PlayStation 4**
- **PlayStation 5**
- **Xbox.**
 
## Games supported.

In order to increase the adoption of the community and to show you the real power of the protocol we have decided to disable the “whitelisted games” and we are happy to announce that we will support 1800+ games right from the start.

Sounds good right?
