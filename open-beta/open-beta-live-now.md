**Hello PlayFam**,

Today is the day we have been waiting for: **Our Play2Earn protocol Open beta is starting NOW!!**

As you know, this is a Beta version of the protocol and we are releasing it to the public to show you the protocol will actually work as we have been advertising it, and to test and gather community feedback to improve the mainnet release of the protocol.

**So, what can you expect?**

1) The main purpose of the open beta is to test the limits, features, and possible bugs of the protocol. Issues/bugs might occur and this is a good thing. 
Feel free to test and use the protocol as much as you want these days. If you have feedback or anything to report, contact the team on the appropriate Discord channel. Now is the time when we can make improvements and fix bugs to improve your experience with the protocol in the future. 

2) The website is showing a simple design that is not final. Changes will be made before the mainnet launch. Once again, if you have something to share, come chat with us on Discord.

3) The open beta will take place on Cronos testnet. 


**Platforms supported:**
We know that we said that due to the change of the roadmap, we would launch the P2E protocol for PC only. Well… We like to over-deliver and we have a good surprise for you.

The protocol will support:
- **PC**
- **PlayStation 4**
- **PlayStation 5**
- **Xbox.**

## Games supported.

In order to increase the adoption of the community and to show you the real power of the protocol we have decided to disable the “whitelisted games” and we are happy to announce that we will support 1800+ games right from the start.

Click [HERE](https://docs.playswap.org/open-beta/supported-games/) to check the complete list of supported games.

Sounds good right? 

## How to start?

To join our protocol and start earning PLAY you just need to:

1) Join our discord server and verify yourself.
2) Open a DM with the bot “P2EManager” identified with the role “Play2Earn Wizard” and type !register “address”

3) start playing

If you don’t know how to connect to the Cronos testnet and create your wallet, click [HERE.](https://docs.playswap.org/open-beta/connect-metamask-to-testnet/

- For testing purposes, you will be able to claim your earnings once a day.

To interact with the blockchain and claim your tokens you will need to have TCRO. You can use [THIS](https://cronos.org/faucet) faucet to get TCRO.

After opening the page you simply need to add your Wallet address and wait for the TCRO to arrive.

This is it. Now is the time to test the protocol, share the project with your friends and bring them on to join our community.

**Together we can do great things.**
