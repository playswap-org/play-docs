# Introduction

PlaySwap is an innovative infrastructure that bridges mainstream gaming, AAA games included, and Web3. The decentralized gaming infrastructure was developed with a specific goal: to become the entry point of the traditional mainstream gaming community in  Blockchain, Crypto and Defi. 

**Vision:** The Playswap vision is that all players should be able to earn by the time they spend playing their favorite video games. This is why PlaySwap enables the community to monetize their time playing games on their PC, Xbox, PS4, and PS5, earning $PLAY without changing their habits and favorite devices. 

On top of that, Playswap AMM swap allows users to boost their earnings based on skill and loyalty. The entire ecosystem includes the  development of a platform where gamers challenge each other and compete on leaderboards. 

An SDK for game developers will enable them to use $PLAY as in-game currency, generating an additional revenue stream while increasing our token utility. 

The Nft marketplace will be open not just for Playswap collections but  external collections as well. 
And with the Nft platform, the gate to use gaming NFTs will be opened bringing in the next level a fully immersive experience of gaming.
 
 
**Fill the Gap:** The mainstream gaming industry is one of the biggest industries in the world, with hundreds of millions of gamers worldwide. Most gamers worldwide like to play AAA games but have no interest in the recent GameFi Web3 industry due the poor quality of the games. On the one hand, they don't like the quality of the games, but on the other hand, they are still not aware of the power of blockchain, crypto and the DeFi ecosystems.  About defi, during the last years (2021-2022) there was a massive growth of the Play to Earn gaming space with a lot of opportunities that the traditional gaming industry has not approached yet. PlaySwap is ready to fill the gap and become the first real bridge between Web2 and Web3.

# Problems to solve

The Playswap team has identified several issues in the current Web2 & Web3 gaming market, let’s analyze them closely in the next points. 

* **Bridge infrastructure:** There is no infrastructure to bridge the mainstream gaming community Web2 to the Web3 and DeFi ecosystems.

* **Entry barrier:** The entry barrier of the existing Web3 games still requires the users to invest capital to start playing and earning. 

* **Time approach:** Top mainstream games don’t allow gamers to monetize the time spent playing directly from their favorite consoles. 

* **User experience:** There is a lack of high-quality experience due to the graphics of the current Web3 games. Web3 gamers don’t play the game they like, but games with low quality compared to Web2. 

* **Crypto knowledge:** To enable mass adoption of Web3 there aren’t enough players from Web2 who have basic crypto knowledge. 

* **No Incentives:** AAA gamers don’t have any incentive to switch to Web3 as it is available today.
Closed ecosystems. Gamers are rewarded in closed and centralized ecosystems, which doesn’t give them a lot of options of what to do with their rewards.

* **Closed ecosystems:** Gamers are rewarded in closed and centralized ecosystems, which doesn’t give them a lot of options of what to do with their rewards.

# Market evaluation

Playswap research is based on the assessment of Newzoo, which is the global standard in games data. 
As you can see on the table below, the mainstream gaming market continues to grow consistently and there is a massive opportunity to bridge Web2 and Web3 gaming.

![](assets/images/marketeval.jpg)

<font size="1"> Source: https://financesonline.com/number-of-gamers-worldwide/</font>

**TAM: $200B revenue, 2.95B gamers worldwide.**

The total addressable market in the gaming industry is huge. In 2021, there were 2.95 billion gamers, and the gaming market generated $200 billion in revenue.

From these figures, only 5% of this revenue was generated by P2E / Web 3.0 games, around $10 billion.

In a ten year horizon, most games will have a Web3 component, from NFT marketplaces (skins, characters, medals, etc..), to in-game currencies and more.  Based on this, companies well positioned to support this transition from traditional gaming to web 3.0 gaming will be poised for explosive growth.   

Therefore PlaySwap wants to become the infrastructure leader that will connect mainstream gaming and Web3 gaming.

<font size="1"> Source: https://financesonline.com/number-of-gamers-worldwide/</font>

As you can see by the table above, just by bridging Consoles to Web3, PlaySwap is targeting 28% of the market that nobody else is still able to target.

On the B2B side, Playswap infrastructure will create new opportunities for Web2 and Web3 game developers to generate new revenue sources, better engage their community of gamers and increase the time they play their games. The complete ecosystem will be the gateway for the mainstream gaming community to join Web3.

# Competition

Why are the major market players unable to add solutions to the problems that Playswap solves?

**Approach, position and target.** The competition is focused on building/becoming the AAA game for Web3 instead of being the bridge that will fill the gap between mainstream gaming and crypto. Most competitors reward users for their skills, and who rewards gamers for time/skills offers closed ecosystems. 

Playswap offers an entire ecosystem that facilitates the adoption of Web3 for mainstream gaming studios and gamers. PlaySwap is fast, decentralized and anyone can swap and earn tokens.

## Products

## AMM Swap

The automated market maker (AMM) of PlaySwap, a fork of Pancackeswap and modified to fit our requirements, allows users to exchange tokens on the BNB blockchain network.

The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their tokens in Liquidity Pools. In exchange, a user gets LP tokens that he can also stack to earn PLAY tokens in the "Farms". When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange, you will pay a 0.2% trading fee, used as follows:

* 0.14% - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.
* 0.04% - Will be used to Buy Back and Burn
* 0.02% - Marketing and investment activities
 
## Farms

PlaySwap Farms offer multiple farming opportunities for users. You can stake your LP tokens and earn PLAY tokens in return. Liquidity pairs will be incentivized by offering to Liquidity Providers the opportunity to stake their LP tokens in the farms available.

Initial Liquidity Pools (LPs) for farming PLAY tokens:
* PLAY/BNB
* PLAY/BUSD

More LPs will come when the ecosystem will rise.
 
## Liquidity pool

When you add liquidity to the pool, you will get LP tokens. Every token swap generates a 0.2% transaction fee. The protocol will return 70% of transaction fee to liquidity providers as reward fees. The liquidity pool will also allow you to stake your LP tokens to earn PLAY tokens in the "Farms".

Remember that providing liquidity is subject to impermanent loss and may carry certain risks. Make sure you know all the pros and cons of providing liquidity before taking any actions.
 
## Gaming infrastructure
The gaming protocol is one of the essential products that will bring the next billion gamers into crypto.

It will enable the mainstream gaming community to earn PLAY tokens while playing top-tier games. When users play their favorite game/games(*if supported by this feature), they will receive PLAY tokens. Therefore, not just the PROs or people with money to buy NFTs, all gamers will create an active income from their hobby without having to invest any capital to start earning.

These gamers will also be able to earn passive PLAY tokens by using the other Core products of PlaySwap. PlaySwap will become the gateway into crypto and DeFi to millions of gamers worldwide with these products. It is specifically developed to fill the gap between mainstream AAA gaming and the GameFi Web3 industry.


## PlaySwap Arena
The gaming and tournaments platform with guild leaderboards is designed to reward the most active users and increase engagement by also rewarding users based on their skills and achievements. 

## Gaming platform
Application to be run by the gamer to improve and increase gaming detection and directly interact with the entire ecosystem.

## SDK for game developers
The project is designed to bring game developers into the PlaySwap ecosystem by giving them the opportunity to create a new revenue stream hassle-free. On the user side, this platform will increase the pool of rewards. 

## NFT marketplace 
Buy/sell/rent NFTs with the rest of the community. The marketplace will be open to list and partner with third part collections.

## NFT platform 
The platform will allow users to use gaming NFTs. 

# Technology
Playswap uses the following technologies to support the product of Playswap: Solidity, Celery, Python, Django, Redis, MySQL, REST, Docker, and Swarm.

Playswap used these technologies to build:
* The gaming infrastructure
* The Oracle to link On-Chain with Off-chain data
* The discord bot
* The custom functionalities developed on top of Pancakeswap fork for the Amm swap

# Business model

Once the infrastructure is fully deployed, Playswap will be highly profitable and positioned as a leader of the sector.

Revenue streams
* Swap fees
* PlaySwap Arena fees
* Gaming platform fees
* NFT marketplace fees
* NFT gaming fees
* Gaming protocol fees
* SDK fees
* B2C advertising

# How it works

## Gaming protocol

The discord bot is where users register their addresses (must be Metamask/other so it can interact with Web3).

The bot manages all the user activities, like pausing the current game session, banning the user in case of fraud, managing profile changes, and counting the gaming time that PlaySwap will convert into token ($PLAY token) earnings.

Every 24h, a cronjob generates the total earnings for all users and interacts with a smart contract to manage payments.

Afterward, users can either claim or send to the holders pool directly from the Web UI of the platform. In both cases, the oracle developed listens for off-chain events and data and triggers on-chain contracts accordingly.

## Token utilities

$PLAY is a critical element of the Playswap infrastructure. It will allow users to benefit from the: 
* Buy/sell from the Amm Swap
* Earn PLAY as rewards from playing your favorite games
* Earn PLAY as rewards from staking LP tokens in our farms
* Stake it in your PLAY pools to earn PLAY and other tokens
* Compete individually and in teams to participate and organize public/private tournaments using $PLAY
* Buy/sell NFTs on the NFT marketplace
* Use gaming NFTs in the NFT platform
* P2E monetization for Web2 & Web3 games
* Play token burn (see the complete program of token burn)

## PLAY token burn

**What is token Burning**

Token burning is the process of permanently removing tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply. Burning tokens can be done in several ways, most commonly by sending tokens to a so-called "eater address" or "dead address."

The "dead address" balance is publicly visible on the blockchain. Still, access to its tokens is unavailable to anyone.

**Why is token burning important?**

* Increase the value of the token
* Increasing the token price is probably the most well-known benefit of a token burn. Token burn reduces the overall circulation. Thereby the overall supply decreases. It might potentially increase the token value. The constant burning of the coin helps to keep a steady price.

**How does token burning at PlaySwap work?**

There will be six deflationary machanisms in place:
* 20% of the NFT Marketplace fees will be used to buy back and burn PLAY tokens
* 20% of the PlaySwap Arena fees will be used to buy back and burn PLAY tokens
* 20% of the gaming platform fees will be used to buy back and burn PLAY tokens
* 80% of the gaming protocol fees will be burned
* 20% of the trading fees are used to buy back tokens and burn them
* 80% of the auto compound Play pool fees will be burned

**PLAY token burn will occur once a month.**

Even though PLAY token burn occurs once a month, PLAY token buyback happens during the month. We will share a final burn report monthly.

<font size="1"> PlaySwap reserves the right in its sole discretion to change or amend the burning schedule at any time and for any reason. </font>
