PlaySwap is a decentralized exchange developed on the Cronos Blockchain with a specific goal: To become the point of entry of the mainstream gaming community into the Cryptoverse.

PlaySwap is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows users to exchange tokens on the Cronos blockchain network. The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their tokens in Liquidity Pools. In exchange, a user gets LP tokens that he can stake to earn PLAY tokens in the "Farms".

But that's not all:
In the past months, we have seen a massive growth of the Play to Earn gaming space. Still, we also noticed that most of these games are not attractive/good enough for the vast majority of the mainstream gaming community. Therefore we are developing a solution that will allow these gamers to generate active and passive income while playing their favorite games.

The mainstream gaming industry is one of the biggest industries in the world, with hundreds of millions of gamers worldwide. The vast majority of gamers worldwide like to play AAA games but have no interest in the recent GameFi industry because of the poor quality of the games. On the one hand, they don't like the quality of the games, but on the other hand, they are still not aware of the power of the cryptoverse and the DeFi ecosystem. Playswap will close this gap and become the bridge between these two worlds.

Our community will be able to play their favorite games and, at the same time, monetize the time they spend gaming. With this monetization, our community will also get to know the cryptoverse, understand the power of DeFi, and potentially become active DeFI, GameFi, Swappers, etc.

We are highly committed to providing actual value, fairness, and innovation to decentralized finance through our high-quality products and services. PlaySwap is fast, secure and anyone can swap and earn tokens.

Are you ready? Let's go!
