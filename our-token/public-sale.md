# Public sale

We are gamers and we are creating this project for gamers. Therefore we will not have a private sale for big investors. Every community member will have access to the same information and token prices. This is a fair launch and it will not matter if you are a small investor or not. The sale will not have a minimum or maximum investment.

So if you believe in our project, this is the best opportunity you have to support our project from the start and enjoy a nice discount that can give you the opportunity to have massive profits in the long run.

**Together we will bring the next billion gamers into crypto!**

# How will we use the funds generated from the token sale?

This funds will be used to develop the project:
- Code audit.
  - Before anything else, we want to pay for an external audit so you can make sure everything is OK and secure with our contracts. 
- Initial liquidity in CRO/Stable coins
  - The initial liquidity for the swap along with the code audit are the 2 most important things we will be able to do with the proceeds of the public sale. The initial liquidity will allow any user to buy/sell tokens from the start increasing the overal experience of the community

- Team growth
  - As you have seen by now, we have big plans and those plans can be developed exponentialy faster if we grow our team.

### Don't know which level to buy-in to?
Here is a small explanation of each level that can help you understand the risk and reward of each level:

**Level 1**
- This level is made for the early adopters. You will have a significant discount on the token price, but at the same time, you will also donâ€™t mind having an 12 months lock-up period on your tokens. You believe in our project and know that in 12months, we will be here, developing the roadmap and creating massive value.

**Level 2**
- The price is higher than phase 1, but the lock-up period is also smaller. Only 6 months. This is a second opportunity for the early adopters who could not buy into the level 1 and for everyone who cannot afford an 12 months lock-up period. The risk is lower, but the potential reward is also smaller, but still massive.
**If you already bought on level 1, you can buy more tokens at this level.** 

**Level 3**
- This level has the higher price of all 3 levels, but the lock-up period is also smaller. Only 3 months.
This is the final opportunity to buy PLAY tokens with a discount.
**If you already bought on level 1 and 2, you can buy more tokens at this level.** 

## How big is the discount? 
- The initial liquidity will be set with a price of 0.5 USDC per PLAY token. As you can see the discount of the sale is massive and can generate you massive profits just by holding the tokens.

# What do you need to invest?

- First you will need a wallet to interact with the blockchain. We advise you to use MetaMask or Crypto.com Defi wallet.
- Then you need to send funds to your wallet. The sale will accept CRO or USDC. You can buy them on Crypto.com and transfer them to your MetaMask or Crypto.com Defi wallet 
To use the blockchain you will always have to pay GAS fees. These fees are paid in CRO. Therefore you should always have a bit of CRO in your wallet. No worries, the GAS fees are small and a balance of 10 CRO is more than enough to keep in your wallet.
- After you send the funds to your wallet, you just need to visit our website and that's it.
