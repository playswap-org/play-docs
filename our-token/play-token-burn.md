## What is token burning?
This is the process of permanently removing tokens from circulation, thereby reducing the total supply. This can be done in several ways, most commonly by sending tokens to a so-called "eater address" or "dead address".
Its current balance is publicly visible on the blockchain, but access to its contents is unavailable to anyone.

## Why is token burning important?
- Increase the value of the token
  - This is probably the most well-known benefit of a token burn. Token burn reduces the overall circulation of the token, thereby the overall supply decreases. It might potentially result in an increase of the token value. The constant burning of the coin helps to keep a steady value.
