# Liquidity pool

When you add liquidity to the pool, you will get LP tokens. Every token swap generates a 0.2% transaction fee. The protocol will return 70% to liquidity providers as reward fees. The liquidity pool will also allow you to stake your LP tokens to earn PLAY tokens in the "Farms".

Hence, apart from earning income from token swap transactions, a user will stake LP tokens and earn PLAY tokens.
Please note that you will need to have a sufficient amount of each token when adding liquidity. You want to add the following liquidity: 1 BNB / 300 BUSD. If you have less than 300 BUSD or less than 1 BNB, you will not be able to proceed. You need to have a sufficient amount of each token.

Remember that providing liquidity is subject to impermanent loss and may carry certain risks. Make sure you know all the pros and cons of providing liquidity before taking any actions.
