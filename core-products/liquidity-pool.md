# Liquidity pool

When you add liquidity to the pool, you will get LP tokens. A transaction fee of 0.2% will be charged when someone makes a token swap. The protocol will return 70% to liquidity providers as reward fees. The liquidity pool will also allow you to stake your LP tokens to earn PLAY tokens in the “Farms”. 

Hence, apart from earning income from token swap transactions, a user will stake LP tokens and earn PLAY tokens.

Please note that you will need to have a sufficient amount of each token when adding liquidity. You want to add the following liquidity: 100 CRO / 50 USDC. If you have less than 50 USDC or less than 100 CRO, you will not be able to proceed. You need to have a sufficient amount of each token. 

Keep in mind that providing liquidity is subject to impermanent loss and it may carry certain risks. Make sure you are aware of all the pros and cons of providing liquidity before taking any actions.
