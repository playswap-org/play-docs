# Play pools

PlaySwap Launchpool (Play pools) is a less resource-intensive alternative to mining. It lets you use your tokens to earn more tokens, for free. Simply put, you lock your cryptocurrency to receive rewards. From the very beginning, a user can stake PLAY tokens in exchange for more PLAY. <br>
In the future there will be more opportunities: PlaySwappers will be able to stake PLAY in exchange for other tokens.
