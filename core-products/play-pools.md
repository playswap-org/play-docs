# Play pools

PlaySwap Launchpool (Play pools) is a less resource-intensive alternative to mining. It lets you use your tokens to earn more tokens for free. Simply put, you lock your cryptocurrency to receive rewards. A user can stake PLAY tokens in exchange for more PLAY from the very beginning.

There will be more opportunities in the future: PlaySwappers will be able to stake PLAY in exchange for other tokens.
