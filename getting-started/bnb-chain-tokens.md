# BNB chain tokens

To operate on the BNB chain you will need two types of tokens:

### Native BNB tokens
- These tokens will serve to pay transaction fees (GAS) on PlaySwap and all other BNB chain Dapps.

## BEP20 tokens
- BEP20 is a token protocol closely resembling Ethereum's ERC-20 for interoperability.
- Except for native BNB, all other tokens are BEP20 tokens.
- Tokens native to other blockchains (BTC, USDC, ETH) are wrapped into BEP20 tokens.
