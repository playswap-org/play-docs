# Cronos chain tokens

To operate on the CRONOS chain you will need two types of tokens:

### Native CRO tokens
- these tokens will serve to pay transaction fees (GAS) on PlaySwap and all other Cronos apps.

## CRC20 tokens
- CRC20 is a token protocol closely resembling Ethereum's ERC-20 for interoperability
- Except for native CRO, all other tokens are CRC20 tokens
- Tokens native to other blockchains are wrapped into CRC20 tokens. (eg. BTC, USDC, ETH)
