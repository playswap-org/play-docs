# Connecting a wallet

PlaySwap is a decentralized platform. Therefore, in order to use the platform you will need a non-custodial crypto wallet.

A crypto wallet is a place where you can hold your assets in your custody. Each time PlaySwap needs to perform a transaction on your behalf, it will need to be confirmed on your wallet for security reasons.

Remember, this a decentralized platform and we will never have custody of your funds.
