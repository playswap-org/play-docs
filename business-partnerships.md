### **What is PlayPools?**

Play pools allow a user to stake PLAY tokens to earn tokens of other projects for Free. The number of tokens received depends on the number of tokens a user has subscribed to the pool and the total amount of PLAY tokens staked in the pool. 

A user can earn the new token over a set period. The user can harvest the pending rewards at any time.
