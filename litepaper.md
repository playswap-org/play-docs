PlaySwap is a decentralized exchange developed on the Cronos Blockchain with a specific goal:
To become the point of entry of the mainstream gaming community into the Cryptoverse. 

PlaySwap is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows a user to exchange tokens on the Cronos blockchain network. The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their tokens in Liquidity Pools. In exchange, a user gets LP tokens that can also be staked to earn PLAY tokens in the "Farms". 

But that's not all:

In the past months, we have seen a massive growth of the Play to Earn gaming space, but we also noticed that most of these games are not attractive/good enough for the vast majority of the mainstream gaming community. Therefore we are developing a solution that will allow these gamers to generate active and passive income while playing their favorite games.

The mainstream gaming industry is one of the biggest industries in the world, with hundreds of millions of gamers worldwide. The vast majority of gamers around the world like to play AAA games and have no interest in the recent GameFi industry. On the one hand, they don‚Äôt like the quality of the games, but on the other hand, they are still not aware of the power of the cryptoverse and the DeFi ecosystem. Playswap will close this gap and become the bridge between these two worlds.

Our community will be able to play their favorite games and, at the same time, monetize the time they spend gaming. With this monetization, our community will also get to know the cryptoverse, understand the power of DeFi, and potentially become active DeFI, GameFi, Swappers, etc.

We are highly committed to providing actual value, fairness, and innovation to decentralized finance through our high-quality products and services. PlaySwap is fast, secure and anyone can swap and earn tokens. 

# PlaySwap

PlaySwap is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows a user to exchange tokens on the Cronos blockchain network. The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their tokens in Liquidity Pools. In exchange, a user gets LP tokens that can also be staked to earn PLAY tokens in the "Farms". 

When you make a token swap \(trade\) on the exchange you will pay a **0.2% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.14%** - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**0.04%** - Will be used to Buy Back and Burn

**0.02%** - Marketing and investment activities

# Play to Earn

Play to Earn is the product that will bring the next billion gamers into crypto.

This is the core principle of our project. This product enables the mainstream gaming community to earn PLAY tokens while playing AAA games. When a user plays his favorite game(*if supported by this feature), he will receive PLAY tokens. Therefore, all gamers, not just the PROs or people with money to buy NFTs from GameFi‚Äôs, will create an active income from their hobby without having to invest any capital to start.

These gamers will also be able to earn passive PLAY tokens by using the other Core products of PlaySwap.

Playswap will become the gateway into crypto and DeFi to millions of gamers worldwide with this feature. 
This product is developed to fill the gap between mainstream AAA gaming and the GameFi industry, where gamers need to invest capital in starting and/or playing games that are not fulfilling their expectations.


Now you will be able to monetize your long-time hobby by playing the games that you love.

**Exciting right? Let's play!**

# Audit

Our swap is a fork of PancakeSwap.

We will apply for an audit right after the public sale.

# Public sale

We are gamers and we are creating this project for gamers. Therefore we will not have a private sale for big investors. Every community member will have access to the same information and token prices. This is a fair launch and it will not matter if you are a small investor or not. The sale will not have a minimum or maximum investment.

So if you believe in our project, this is the best opportunity you have to support our project from the start and enjoy a nice discount that can give you the opportunity to have massive profits in the long run.

**Together we will bring the next billion gamers into crypto!**

# How will we use the funds generated from the token sale?

This funds will be used to develop the project:
- Code audit.
  - Before anything else, we want to pay for an external audit so you can make sure everything is OK and secure with our contracts. 
- Initial liquidity in CRO/Stable coins
  - The initial liquidity for the swap along with the code audit are the 2 most important things we will be able to do with the proceeds of the public sale. The initial liquidity will allow any user to buy/sell tokens from the start increasing the overal experience of the community

- Team growth
  - As you have seen by now, we have big plans and those plans can be developed exponentialy faster if we grow our team.

# Public sale details

The public sale is divided in 3 phases (levels):

| Level | Start | End | Lock up period | Payout | Available tokens | Price in CRO |Price in USDC|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | 04/09/2022 | 04/13/2022 | 12 months | 50% + 6 months linear | 5M PLAY | TBD*  |0.1 USDC|
| Level 2 | 04/16/2022 | 04/20/2022 | 6 months | 50% + 6 months linear | 3.75M PLAY | TBD* |0.2 USDC|
| Level 3 | 04/23/2022 | 04/27/2022 | 3 months | 100% | 1.25M PLAY | TBD*|0.4 USDC|

*To make your life easier you can pay with CRO or USDC when buying tokens in the public sale. The CRO price will be defined at the start of each level of the public sale.


### Don't know which level to buy-in to?
Here is a small explanation of each level that can help you understand the risk and reward of each level:

**Level 1**
- This level is made for the early adopters. You will have a significant discount on the token price, but at the same time, you will also don‚Äôt mind having an 12 months lock-up period on your tokens. You believe in our project and know that in 12months, we will be here, developing the roadmap and creating massive value.

**Level 2**
- The price is higher than phase 1, but the lock-up period is also smaller. Only 6 months. This is a second opportunity for the early adopters who could not buy into the level 1 and for everyone who cannot afford an 12 months lock-up period. The risk is lower, but the potential reward is also smaller, but still massive.
**If you already bought on level 1, you can buy more tokens at this level.** 

**Level 3**
- This level has the higher price of all 3 levels, but the lock-up period is also smaller. Only 3 months.
This is the final opportunity to buy PLAY tokens with a discount.
**If you already bought on level 1 and 2, you can buy more tokens at this level.** 

## How big is the discount? 
- The initial liquidity will be set with a price of 0.5 USDC per PLAY token. As you can see the discount of the sale is massive and can generate you massive profits just by holding the tokens.

# What do you need to invest?

- First you will need a wallet to interact with the blockchain. We advise you to use MetaMask or Crypto.com Defi wallet.
- Then you need to send funds to your wallet. The sale will accept CRO or USDC. You can buy them on Crypto.com and transfer them to your MetaMask or Crypto.com Defi wallet 
To use the blockchain you will always have to pay GAS fees. These fees are paid in CRO. Therefore you should always have a bit of CRO in your wallet. No worries, the GAS fees are small and a balance of 10 CRO is more than enough to keep in your wallet.
- After you send the funds to your wallet, you just need to visit our website and that's it.
